Problem J4: From Prefix to Postfix
Prefix notation is a non-conventional notation for writing arithmetic expressions.
The standard way of writing arithmetic expressions, also known as infix notation,
positions a binary operator between the operands, e.g., 3 + 4, while in prefix notation the operator
is positioned before the operands, e.g., + 3 4. Similarly, the prefix notation for 5 - 2 is - 5 2.
A nice property of prefix expressions with binary operators is that parentheses are not required
since there is no ambiguity
about the order of operations. For example, the prefix representation of 5 - (4 - 2) is - 5 - 4 2,
while the prefix representation of (5 - 4) - 2 is - - 5 4 2. The prefix notation is also known as Polish notation,
due to Jan ≈Åukasiewicz, a Polish logician, who invented it around 1920.

Similarly, in postfix notation, or reverse Polish notation, the operator is positioned after the operands.
For example, postfix representation of the infix expression (5 - 4) - 2 is 5 4 - 2 -.

Your task is to write a program that translates a prefix arithmetic expression into a postfix arithmetic expression.

Input
Each line contains an arithmetic prefix expression. The operators are + and -,
and numbers are all single-digit decimal numbers. The operators and numbers are separated by exactly one space
with no leading spaces on the line. The end of input is marked by 0 on a single line. You can assume that each input line contains a valid prefix expression with less than 20 operators.

Output
Translate each expression into postfix notation and produce it on a separate line. The numbers and operators are
separated by at least one space. The final 0 is not translated.

Sample Input
1
+ 1 2
- 2 2
+ 2 - 2 1
- - 3 + 2 1 9
0

Sample Output
1
1 2 +
2 2 -
2 2 1 - +
3 2 1 + - 9 -
